# Tool Design Studio
Building a creative management tool through iteration.

## Overview
Tools like Trello & Asana are quite powerful but integration with the tasks they are organizing is acheived with extensions. What if it went the other way, with the organizational and structural flow driving the whole process?

This is a series of experiments to find a proof-of-concept that expresses this action. Currently I'm interested in processes for code development and 2D art.


## Thoughts
*  Building is the aggregation of snippets. Files don't matter as much as individual functions.
*  Paths and layers can also be considered tasks.
